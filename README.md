# Day Planner

This application helps you plan your 9a-5p workflow. The application can be found here: https://cobypear.github.io/DayPlanner/ 

As you can see in the GIF below, the scheduler displays the day and time.
The hour blocks are color coded depending on if the time is past (grey), future (green), or present (red).
If you click the save button on the block you've entered text in, the text will persist through reloading the page.
May you find productivity in your workday.
